	<h1>Lavinia</h1>	
	<p>I am an agile (web) developer. I have recently changed directions in my life from working with horses. I am curious and really want to learn. My interests are mainly backend programming (yes, I program rear ends :-) )
	</p>
	
	<h3> Things IÂ´ve learned the last 2 years</h3>
	<p>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby (with Rails and Sinatra), MySQL, PHP, Java, C#, Python (Django), Objective C, Kanban, The Pomodoro Technique, Scrum and a lot more. I have also contributed to Rails. My dream is to write programs any idiot can use.</p>
	
	<h2>Nemah</h2>
	<p>This is who I spend my spare time with. She is an arabian and will be 8 years old i May.</p>
